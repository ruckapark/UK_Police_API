# User intstructions

--- 

This is a very simple function I have written that requires no external files.  

Libraries used:  
* **Requests** uses get() to retrieve the API address
* **json** to take into account the nature of the data retrieved from the server

Modify **parameters** to make the data relevant to any points in the UK. The radius of the point given is 1km.
